Erlang port of [libphonenumber][1]

## Notes

- This project is active. I'm doing updates very offen because I see the original author is no longer maintaining it.
- Compatible with both `rebar` and `rebar3` or `hex`
- To change the `libphonenumber` version modify in `rebar.config` the `TAG` argument sent to `make`

## Compile

In order to compile you need to make sure all dependencies needed to build `libphonenumber` are already installed.

Next you can find a resume for each operating system where library was tested but in case you encounter problems you can 
consult as well the documentation from building `libphonenumber` located [here][2]

##### Ubuntu or Debian

On the latest versions it's enough to do:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake cmake-curses-gui libgtest-dev libicu-dev 
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```

##### CentOS 7

Enable [EPEL][3] (for RE2 & gtest):
```bash
sudo yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
```

And install packages:
```bash
sudo yum install cmake git gtest-devel libicu-devel protobuf-devel protobuf-compiler
```

##### Mac Os

On `Mac OS` make sure you have `brew` installed and rebar will automatically install all necessary dependencies.
 
## Get carrier for number
    
In order to do this make sure the application is started then use `phonenumber_to_carrier:carrier_for_number/2` method    
    
```erlang 
application:ensure_all_started(elibphonenumber).
phonenumber_to_carrier:carrier_for_number(<<"44743655551">>, <<"en">>).
```    

## Run the tests

```bash
rebar3 eunit
```
